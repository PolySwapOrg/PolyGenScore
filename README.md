# GR10 - Polygen Score for Polygon Network

### Degen and Proof of Experience project 

### [Website](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/)
It made more sense to us to integrate Degen and Proof of Experience together inorder to enhance hodlers learning curve and improve loyalty on the Polygon network for a protocol by rewarding them with Tokens, NFTS.

Things we have accompished in this project :

### Degen :
- Generate PolyGen score by evaluating Interactions on  more than 300+ Smart Contracts.
- We have categorized each smart contract as - SWAP, LEND/BORROW Protocol (DeFi), FARMS, RUG, LIQUIDITY PROVIDER.
- Based on the current TVL (Total Value Locked) on each smart contract, we have assigned points to each Smart contract.

 ### Proof of Experience :
- We have calculated number of Interactions made to each Smart Contract, if certain thresholf number of Interactions achieved - They can mint a NFT.
- We have created a sample of 13 NFTS for the projects that has higher TVL and hosted them on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). 
- Deployed a ERC 721 Smart Contract that handles non tranferable NFT minting. 
- We made NFT non tranferable as these NFTs or Proof are experience can only be earned but never bought ;>
